challenge for Jr tech support 

The challenge was use HTML, CSS, JS and the Cylindo HD 360 Viewer Library, which will be the tools you will be working with to provide support to Cylindo users.

The solution was the next:

Using visual studio code as HTML editor I created 3 files:

- home.html
- mystyle.css
- myscript.js

The home.html page has all the basic implementation, in it has the calls to the external files like Cylindo viewer handler, cylindo css style, CSS styles for the features selector and the javascript that reacts to those features (like color of the fabrics and material used for the legs)

The example shown in the Cylindo documentation needed to be adaptated because I needed to put some references before the BODY and some after the BODY, and also add a reference to the JQuery library to avoid an error the example has, it means there is a section that the web browsers are unable to handle without the proper jQuery functions.

That was all.

Thanks!!
